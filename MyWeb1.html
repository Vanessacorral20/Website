      <p>My name is Vanessa Corral. I am a Computer Science major and I 
am currently a Senior at UHD that will be graduating in December 2023.
Some of my hobbies involve listening to music, painting, and I recently 
began working out! This gif of Mr. Potato head is me trying to do upper 
body workouts, I am very weak, but I am working on it. My favorite artist right now is Bad Bunny he is a Latin
artist. The little penguin is me listening to music because I absolutely love 
music it is my life and the best way for me to express myself and I feel like
music brings a connection to the emotions which is hard to reach in another way. 
I also enjoy skateboarding it is a really nice hobby to have to stay fit as
 well as roller skating. I am still learning to roller skate, but I will get
 there soon as long as I keep practicing. I also enjoy getting things on 
Amazon! I get things pretty often from there, so I thought it would be best
 to invest in the amazon prime. Now, my family takes advantage of it as well
. Another website I like using is Apple. I love my apple products and I am 
planning to buy myself an iPhone 14! You can check out the links to my 
favorite websites down below!  </p>
